1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,300
This is the story of how I finally found love...

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,700
...In London.

3
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Yes!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Excuse me.

5
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,000
Siobhan! It's Roise.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh hi Rose.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Well... I've got myself a date!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh good.
Michael, can you get the baby?

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,200
I haven't actually met him yet,
I'm meeting him tonight.

10
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,700
But he sounds so handsome.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think by tomorrow I could have a boyfriend.

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,500
Well Stephen's teddy is on his bed an daddy's rugby kit's
in the airing cupboard where it always is.

13
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Not from the single's club then?

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,500
Single brain cell more like!

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I want someone with some wit and sophistication.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,200
I met him on the internet.
You know - one of those chatroom things.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
So you haven't actually met him yet?

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,200
We're meeting for the first time tonight.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well you must have seen his picture?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
Well... No.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Rosie!
Well how much do you know about him?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh, he's sent me tonnes of emails about himself.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And..?

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, I think he lives somewhere across town.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He says he lives in a big house.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,600
He says his main interests are...

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,300
art...

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,300
...le cinema...

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
...and literature.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, and apparently his mates all tell him
he looks the spitting image off...

31
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Brad Pitt!

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's probably because his big hobby is working out in the gim.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Oh, and to top it all he says
he's really into fashion

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Well - he sounds like a dream.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah! Doesn't he?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
After my run of luck it'll be nice
to finally meet someone...

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,500
...with some brains and some get-up-and-go.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Put it this way Siobhan -

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think I need a strong cup of tea
for my nerves.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,500
He sounds so fantastic.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
I hope I'm not going to be a let-down for him.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Oh Rosie.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
And I don't know what I'm going to wear.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
I haven't got a thing.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Will you calm down Rosie.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
Whatever you're wearing
he's lucky to be meeting you.

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,500
Look Rose love, I've really got to go.
It's the baby's feeding time.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
What time is it?

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
Oh - around five-thirty.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh God! I'd better get going too!

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm meeting him at eight.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
I bet he's not feeling this giddy.

53
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll just have an orange juice please.

54
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Could you just stick a vodka in there?

55
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm not on my own you know.

56
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm just waiting for a friend.

57
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, he's more of a boyfriend really.

58
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We've been exchanging emails, you know...

59
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
I think he's really fallen for me.

60
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Hello?

61
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Rosie! So what's he like?

62
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
How's it going tiger?

63
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hello? Siobhan? Is that you?

64
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
You're breaking up. I can't -

65
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
I can't hear you.

66
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hello?

67
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Wrong number.

68
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,500
I expect he's having a bit of trouble with the trains...
... or something.

69
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
He's, um... a bit late.

70
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
I know!

71
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If he's not here in the next thirty seconds
then he is deep in the -

72
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Two seconds!

73
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The next two seconds, I'm telling you!

74
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Right! That's it! I've had enough.

75
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
If I ever see him I'm going to kill him.

76
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
I say! You've forgotten your bag.

77
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, Damn!

78
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't believe he didn't even make the effort.

79
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
It'd be a shame to leave it behind.

80
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
Especially when it goes so well with your eyes.

81
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
Thanks for this.

82
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Look, could I buy you a drink or something?

83
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well... It's really quiet in here tonight.
I was thinking of locking up early.

84
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,500
But I know a place not too far away
where they do a nice cognac.

85
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,600
So, do you share this place with... anyone?

86
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No I live alone. Terribly alone.

87
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh. It could do with a female touch.

88
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's not the only thing.

89
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Well - can I get you that drink?

90
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Would you like a short?

91
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
No. I'd like -

92
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And that is the story of how I finally found love.

93
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,500
But I never did find out what became of my blind date.
