THE QML FILE CAN ONLY BE LOADED FROM A HTTP SOURCE. (the demo will not work on your local Hard Drive)

Make sure to upload the Demo on a Hosting Server to see it working correctly!


* The QML Source will not work on your local machine because it is subject of a security feature that does not allow loading of any local editable file.
